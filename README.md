## Status

**Tin** is currently in **alpha** version. It has never been released and currently it's only an idea that we're developing. Please, please, please, **do not** use this in production!

---

## Description

**Tin** is a lightweight Open Source Key/Value storage atom developed in **Rust**.

It exposes a simple HTTP API made with **Rocket** where all the actions are sent to. These are the currently available ones:
- `GET /store/get/<key>` to retrieve the value associated with the input key;
- `POST /store/set/<key>` with the following body `{"value": VALUE, "expiration": 0}` to set the VALUE for the given key;
- `POST /store/setexp/<key>` with the following body `{"value": VALUE, "expiration": EXPIRATION}` to set the VALUE and EXPIRATION of the given key;
- `DELETE /store/delete/<key>` to remove the value associated with the input key;
- `GET /queues/<queue_name>` to retrieve information about the queue with the input name;
- `DELETE /queues/<queue_name>` to delete the queue with the input name;
- `POST /queues/<queue_name>/create` to create a new queue with the input name;
- `POST /queues/<queue_name>/push` with the following body `{"value": "VALUE"}` to push the VALUE into the queue;
- `POST /queues/<queue_name>/clear` to clear all the content inside the queue with the given name.
