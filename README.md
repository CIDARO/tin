## Status

**Tin** is currently in **alpha** version. It has never been released and currently it's only an idea that we're developing. Please, please, please, **do not** use this in production!

---

## Description

**Tin** is a lightweight Open Source Key/Value storage atom developed in **Rust**.

It exposes a simple HTTP API made with **Rocket** where all the actions are sent to. These are the currently available ones:
- `/get/<key>` to retrieve the value associated with the input key;
- `/set/<key>` with the following body `{"value": VALUE, "expiration": 0}` to set the VALUE for the given key;
- `/setexp/<key>` with the following body `{"value": VALUE, "expiration": EXPIRATION}` to set the VALUE and EXPIRATION of the given key;
- `/delete/<key>` to remove the value associated with the input key.

---

## TODO List

- [x] Minimal key/value pair operations
- [x] HTTP API using Rocket (currently considering Actix or Warp too)
- [ ] CLI configuration
- [ ] Persistence
- [ ] Replication
- [ ] Encryption
- [ ] Dockerfile
- [ ] Compression (?)
- [ ] Queues implementation (Redis wannabe?)
